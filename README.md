<ul>
  <li>Tyler C is going to start the repo readme/documentation. The readme will have this weekâ€™s goals in it to start, but will be updated each week to reflect features and future implementations. This will also serve as the bulleted list of features that we will show to the client.</li>
  <li>Hayden is going to research APIs to see how we pull music from a source like SoundCloud. He is also going to compare it to just hosting the music files on the server and see which is better. This is budgeted to take 10 hours.</li>
  <li>Juan is going to set up the Authentication into a Mongo Database. This includes setting up secure data storage with encryption. He is also going to research News APIs. </li>
  <li>Tyler J is going to research APIs and work on getting a functioning news feed to show up on the front page. This is budgeted to take 6 hours.</li>
  <li>Sione is going to research websocket communications and MERN interfaces to build a communication interface. He will also be looking into establishing room communication between users, and between the frontend and the backend.</li>
